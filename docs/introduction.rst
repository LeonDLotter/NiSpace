Introduction
============

The following pages provide introductions on how to use ``NiSpace``. They are build from downloadable Jupyter notebooks.
Please note that these pages are under construction and will be adjusted and extended in the future.

For a nice introduction to spatial colocalization analyses and spatial colocalization null testing, also see the `neuromaps` docs.
