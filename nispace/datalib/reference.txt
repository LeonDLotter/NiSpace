# pet
The NiSpace "PET" dataset is based on openly available nuclear imaging maps largely accessed via neuromaps 
(https://neuromaps-main.readthedocs.io/). The maps are downloaded via neuromaps, processed on-the-fly, and cached locally 
(find them in `~HOME/nispace-data/reference/pet/map`). The accompanying metadata table contains detailed information about 
tracers, source samples, original publications and data sources, as well as the publication licenses. Every map should be 
cited when used. The responsibility for this lies with the user! We additionally ask to cite:
- Markello et al., 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01625-w)
- Hansen et al., 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01186-3)
- Dukart et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25244)


# mrna
The NiSpace "mRNA" dataset is based on Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) gene expression data published in Hawrylycz et al., 
2012 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11405). The AHBA dataset consists of mRNA expression data from postmortem brain tissue of 
six donors, mapped into imaging space using the abagen toolbox (Markello et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72129).
In addition to those two publications, please cite publications associated with gene set collections as appropriate.


# rsn
The NiSpace "RSN" dataset is based on resting-state network probability maps generated by Dworetsky et al., 2021
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118164). The maps are downloaded from the associated GitHub repository
(https://github.com/GrattonLab/Dworetsky_etal_ConsensusNetworks), processed on-the-fly, and cached locally (find them in 
`~HOME/nispace-data/reference/rsn/map`). Please cite the original publication when using these maps.
